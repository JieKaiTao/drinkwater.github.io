Hi, I'm short on time so here is a brief overview on how to refer someone:
<br>
<ul>
    <li> Your <b>referral ID is your user ID.</b><li>
    <li> Tell your referee to type it in the referral code when signing up.</li>
    <li> Your referee needs to verify his/her account by clicking the verification link in his/her email before any coins can be credited</li>
</ul>

<br>
Thank you,
<br>
Jack
